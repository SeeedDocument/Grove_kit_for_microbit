The BBC micro:bit is a pocket-sized computer that can easily realize your creativity without much electrical and coding knowledge. There are numerous possibility of creation you can dig out by micro:bit, from robots to musical instruments. However if you want to create more things, just 1 micro:bit is barely not enough, That’s why we introduce the Grove Inventor Kit for micro:bit to you.

The Grove Inventor Kit for Micro:bit brings endless possibilities to your micro:bit. The core board in this kit is the Grove shield for micro:bit, with which you can use plenty of Grove modules including sensors, display, actuator to interact with micro:bit. If you never used and have no idea what grove is, here is the introduction of Grove. All you need to know is that with Grove, there is no need of soldering or jump wires any more. Your prototyping will be easier and much more convenient.

We have already prepared 8 grove modules to let you get started with micro:bit. With these grove modules, you can measure distance and display it, use gesture to play different music, or make a smart guard for your desk or room. We have prepared all the necessary libraries(packages) for free download. If you are a beginner to micro:bit, don’t worry because we have also prepare 12 different project which can teach you step by step. If you are an advanced user, this kit will help you more creative project than others.

##  Getting Started

###  Fundamentals with  Micro:bit

You need to know some essential knowledge if it is the first time that you get involved with Micro:bit. You can click [here](https://microbit.org/code/) to see more about Micro:bit.

Micro:bit offers two type of editor : JavaScript Block Editor and Python Editor. JavaScript Block Editor support graphical programming,it's easy to learn. And this Tutorial is based on JavaScript Block Editor.


###  Step1.Open the Editor

Please click here to open the JavaScript Block Editor,and you will see below

After you have gotten an LED blinking (for Windows user, you can find it at [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows), you can find other versions for Mac OS and Linux variants at
[https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) ), you still need to get familiar with Seeedstudio Grove system at [http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_System](/Grove_System). And now, you can do some more practical quizzes which are specialized designed for this kit. Download the sketches of quizzes at [https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Sketchbook_Starter_Kit_for_Arduino](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Sketchbook_Starter_Kit_for_Arduino).
